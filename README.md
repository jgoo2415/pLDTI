## Publication

This repository provides a set of MATLAB codes for simulations used in the following paper:

Goo, J., Sakhanenko, L. & Zhu, D.C. Test for changes between paired integral curves with application to Diffusion Tensor Imaging (Manuscript submitted for publication)

There are three main codes for running simulations.

1. **simulation_example_H0.m** This script simulates an artificial fiber tract whose orientation does not change over time.

2. **simulation_example_H1.m** This script simulates an artificial fiber tract whose orientation changes over time (thinning in the x2-direction).

3. **simulation_example_H2.m** This script simulates an artificial fiber tract whose orientation changes over time (lowering in the x2-direction & decreasing fractional anisotropy).
